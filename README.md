## Highlights

- GPU-accelerated FWI module with checkpointing schemes;
- AMG-accelerated implicit pressure-implicit saturation scheme;
- Time Fractional Partial Differential Equations

## Philosophy

We treat physical simulations as a chain of multiple differentiable operators, such as discrete Laplacian evaluation, a Poisson solver, and a single implicit time-stepping for nonlinear PDEs. They are like building blocks that can be assembled to make simulation tools for new physical models.

Those operators are differentiable and integrated within a computational graph so that the gradients can be computed automatically and efficiently via analyzing the dependency in the graph. Also, independent operators run in parallel thanks to the graph-based parallelization mechanism of TensorFlow. With the gradients, we can perform gradient-based PDE-constrained optimization for inverse problems. 

FwiFlow is built on [ADCME](https://github.com/kailaix/ADCME.jl), a powerful static-graph-based automatic differentiation library for scientific computing (with TensorFlow backend). FwiFlow implements the idea of **Intrusive Automatic Differentiation**.
